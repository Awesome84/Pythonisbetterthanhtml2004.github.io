    Hello my Name is Landon. I feel like my spirit animal would be a cow. I feel like a cow is my spirit animal because I like
    <br> stand around all day and do nothing. Another reason why I feel like a cow would be my spirit animal is they have
    <br> a great memory. The last reason why I feel a cow is my spirit  animal is they form great friendships.
